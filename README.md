# CC-Music (being rebuilt (please use main branch))
CC-Music is a simple and easy-to-use music player that lets you play all of your favorite tunes with just a few clicks. With CC-Music, you no longer have to worry about managing all your music - everything is in one easy-to-access place. However, please note that we are currently in the process of rebuilding CC-Music from the ground up, so many features have not yet been implemented. At this time, it is not possible to add songs without messing with the file system, so we do not recommend installing CC-Music at this time. Keep an eye out for updates as we continue to improve and add new features to CC-Music.
